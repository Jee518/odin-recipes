            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
            <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
